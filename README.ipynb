    "Neurogenic bladder dysfunction caused by SCI leads to uncontrolled urination or inability to empty bladder, which could pose a threat on patients’ lives. Recent studies on animals showed that stimulation on spinal cord (SCS) could improve the ability of bladder control. While parallels between the effects on bladder function of more established techniques like electrical stimulation of the pudendal nerve exists,  the mechanisms by which SCS interacts with spinal circuits controlling the bladder is still unclear. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, computational models simulating epidural electrical stimulation on pudendo-vesical reflex represent an interesting tool to study the parallels between SCS and peripheral nerve stimulation of specific bladder afferent and efferent fibers. This repository contains the code of a computational model of bladder spinal reflexes for peripheral nerve stimulation. Several components of the model are constructed based on the previous study[1][2]:  "
